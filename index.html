                    My name is <a href="Shed.html">Ash</a>, I'm 25 years old, and I am an aspiring software engineer. 
                    While I was studying physics at UCL, I learned Python as part of PHAS0030
                    to model the orbits of planets. I became interested in pursuing coding further 
                    once I left, since the process of constant problem-solving appealed to me greatly.

                    I like to bake cakes. Here's one I made for a Christmas party a few years back,
                    near the start of my baking journey.

                    I adore apes and monkeys alike. Here's some pictures I took 
                    at Monkey World, along with a bonus picture of the monkey 
                    paraphrenalia I have at home.
