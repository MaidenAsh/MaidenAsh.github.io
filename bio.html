                    My name is Ash, I'm 25 years old, and I am an aspiring software engineer. 
                    While I was studying physics at UCL, I learned Python as part of PHAS0030
                    to model the orbits of planets. I became interested in pursuing coding further 
                    once I left, since the process of constant problem-solving appealed to me greatly.
